          Weâ€™re a unique group of people at NemFra and we only say that because
          we do things differently, and that difference comes from the way we
          were founded. NemFra fondly coined from "Nne m (My Mother)" and
          "Franca" was named after Late Franca Ogwudu - a teacher known for her
          love of family and passion for science and tech. This sums up why we
          regard our customers as family deserving the best with full
          transparency while leveraging the powers of technology
