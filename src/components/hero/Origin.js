            Weâ€™re a unique group of people at NemFra and we only say that
            because we do things differently, and that difference comes from the
            way we were founded. NemFra fondly coined from "Nne m (My Mother)"
            and "Franca" was named after Late Franca Ogwudu - a teacher known
            for her love of family and passion for science and tech. This sums
            up why we regard our customers as family deserving the best with
            full transparency while leveraging the powers of technology
